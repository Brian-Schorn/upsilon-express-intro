# Express Routing Challenge

## Author: Brian Schorn

##Purpose: To demonstrate comprehension of Ajax and Express principles covered so far. The app accesses a JSON object, consisting of an array of two objects with properties Title, Artist, & Album. It then updates the Dom with this information. It also has a form field for adding additional songs to the array. It tests if these are duplicates or if any field is blank before adding it to the array and updating the DOM. It also adds a dateAdded property to new objects of the array which is set equal to the current date.
